Machine Learning and Predictive Analytics - Spring 2023 - Ashlyn Fentem

**Problem statement:**

Image recognition is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and models capable of analyzing and understanding the content of images, enabling computers to identify and classify objects, scenes, and patterns within visual data. Being able to detect a personâ€™s gender from an image of them can be especially useful for advertisement targeting. Gender detection can provide insights into gender-specific preferences and behaviors. Advertisements and marketing campaigns can be customized based on the detected gender of the target audience.
